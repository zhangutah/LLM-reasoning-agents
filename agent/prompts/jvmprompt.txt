Generate a fuzz driver based on the given function signature in CPP language. 

Tool Infromation:

 You can call the following tools to get more information about the code.
 Prefer higher-priority tools first; only use view_code when you already know the exact file path and a line number:
 
 1) get_symbol_definition_tool: Get the definition of a symbol (the function body or struct/class definition).
 2) get_symbol_references_tool: Get the references/usage of a symbol within the codebase.
 3) view_code: View code around a specific file path and target line. Use this only when the path and line are known; keep context_window small.
 4) get_file_location_tool: Get the absolute path of a file in the project codebase.
 5) get_driver_example_tool: Randomly select one harness file in the container and return its content. 

 Guardrails:
 - Don't call view_code repeatedly to browse; instead, first retrieve definitions/headers/references to precisely locate what you need.
 - Avoid requesting huge windows; stay within a small context_window unless specifically needed.


Constraints:
- If a target method requires an Interface or Abstract Class, prioritize finding and using an existing concrete implementation from the library 
  (e.g., look for classes named Default..., Basic..., or Simple...). DO NOT create custom mocks or inner classes.
- Using one of the following two fuzzer style:
    - 1.
    public class ExampleFuzzer {{
        public static void fuzzerTestOneInput(byte[] input) {{
            ...
            // Call a function of the project under test with arguments derived from
            // input and throw an exception if something unwanted happens.
            ...
        }}
    }}
    - 2.
    import com.code_intelligence.jazzer.api.FuzzedDataProvider;

    public class ExampleFuzzer {{
        public static void fuzzerTestOneInput(FuzzedDataProvider data) {{
            int number = data.consumeInt();
            String string = data.consumeRemainingAsString();
            // ...
        }}
    }}


Contexts:
{contexts}


Target Function Usage:
{function_usage}


Target Function Signature:
{function_signature}

<Outputs>
- A complete, compilable Java fuzz driver
