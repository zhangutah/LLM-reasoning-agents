## Code Indexing Tools

This project supports two methods for code indexing: **cscope** and **LSP**. Follow the instructions below to set up and use the tool of your choice.

---

### 1. Using `cscope`

`cscope` is a classic source code browsing tool that helps you navigate codebases efficiently. Follow these steps to build and use a `cscope` database:

#### Build the `cscope` Database:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
find . -name "*.c" -o -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" > cscope.files
cscope -q -R -b -i cscope.files
```

- `find`: Searches for source files (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`) in the project directory.
- `cscope -q -R -b -i cscope.files`: Builds the `cscope` database using the list of files generated by `find`.

### 2. Using LSP (Language Server Protocol)

LSP provides modern features like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and real-time code analysis. Below are the steps to run an LSP server using Docker.

#### Run the LSP Server:

1. Pull the Docker image for the LSP server:

   ```bash
   docker pull zhangutah/eclipse.jdt.ls
   ```

2. Start the LSP server container:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it zhangutah/eclipse.jdt.ls bash
   ```

3. Navigate to the workspace directory inside the container and run the testing script:

   ```bash
   cd /home/mlc/packages/examples/resources/eclipse.jdt.ls/workspace
   python3 javalsp.py
   ```

### Choosing the Right Tool

- Use **cscope** for lightweight, terminal-based code navigation.
- Use **LSP** for advanced IDE-like features and better integration with modern editors.
